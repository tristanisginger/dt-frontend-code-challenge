# DT Frontend Code Challenge

With no Figma or Sketch file it is not easily possible to get the colours, gradients, font and spacings exact. I could have spend more time to achieve a slightly closer look but didn't think it necessary as I don't expect to be working from an image.

I decided not to use any classes to style the elements on the page and use the elements themselves, I could have added classes to each element and targeted those but as there was no risk of clashing styles I went with the most streamlined option rather than showing off my snazzy class labeling skills. 

The design does not allow for the HTML5 date input to be used which I would feedback.
